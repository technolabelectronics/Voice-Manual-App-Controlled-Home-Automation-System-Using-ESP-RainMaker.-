# Introduction.
Hey hello friends, welcome to another article, In this article , we are going to make a very useful and very easy home-automation system.
You can easily make this home automation system even if you don't know anything about coding....yes you heard right this project is as simple as that.
In this home-automation project you can control your home-appliances through Voice Command , App Control ,and from manual switch buttons.
In this home-automation project I am going to use ESP rain maker app. which we will easily integrate to the ESP32.
In this article, I will show how to control total 4 devices as I am going to use my 4 Node SMT Smart Home-Automation PCB.
And Apart from this 4 node , I also have 8 node and 2 node home automation PCBs. These PCBs are fully tested and works very well.
